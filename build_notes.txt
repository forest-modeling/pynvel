# Currently the Python dependencies are not working correctly and CMake

#  Until fixed simply make the following edits CMakelist.txt
#  in the second Python block before executing the build.

# libpython (mingw python libraries) does not always ship with Python
#  and needs to be created. If it's missing you'll generally see a long list of

# Errors of multiple definitions of atonexit, etc following the above may 
#  be due to libmsvcr100.a which appears to be include with some conda packages
#  it can be deleted since it is (should be) included with mingw w64.

# Install locally in development mode
pip install -e .

# Tests currently require nose2 for automated execution
