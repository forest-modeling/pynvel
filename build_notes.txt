# Currently the Python dependencies are not working correctly and CMake
#  will try to build the Python extension before the vollib libraries.
#  Until fixed simply make the following edits CMakelist.txt
#  in the second Python block before executing the build.
#    # if (PYTHON)
#    if (0)

cmake --build . --target install

# now manually execute the Python extension build
cd ..\pynvel

# Tests currently require nose2 for automated execution
#  Nose2 may not be on conda
#  >pip install nose2

# if all goes well then package
