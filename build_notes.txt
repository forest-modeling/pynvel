# This will build the nvel libraries and move them to the python\pynvel 
# folder. The Python extension will also be compiled.

# Python and numpy/distutils do not have proper support for MinGW compilers.
# The subfolder python\numpy_fix contains patched files with a working hack.

# libpython (mingw python libraries) does not always ship with Python
#  and needs to be created. If it's missing you'll generally see a long list of
#  of "undefined reference" errors pointing to __imp_... Python routines
#  during the build_ext step below.
python gen_libpython.py

# Other causes of "undefined reference" errors pointing coming from 
# libgfortran seem to be related to rogue libraries in the Conda packaging
# These can be overcome by re-initiating a new Conda environment.

python setup.py build_ext --inplace --static

# Errors of multiple definitions of atonexit, etc following the above may 
#  be due to libmsvcr100.a which appears to be include with some conda packages
#  it can be deleted since it is (should be) included with mingw w64.

# Install locally in development mode
pip install -e .

# Tests can be run using pytest
pytest pynvel\test
pynvel run-tests

# if all goes well then package
python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist bdist_msi
